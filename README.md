## Machine Learning Models

In this section, we have implemented two prediction modules: 
- one for predicting if the heart is diseased based on input data (analyses),
- another for segmentation (these are initial models).

## Flask

We were able to deploy our models in Flask and connect them within our application (Heart Disease Prediction).

### To run flask app 
- pip install flask_cors
- npm dev run
